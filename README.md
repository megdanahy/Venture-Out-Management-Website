# Outdoor Recreation Management Web Application
## This is an HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and CSS based website created for my Web-Based Decision Support Systems class. Through this website, one can act as either admin or customer, and manage rentals, event registration, orders, receipts, and customer satisfaction.
The raw HTML files are all gathered in this repository, and for sake of ease, I've attached my demonstration video to elaborate on what each page does without requiring mass amounts of file downloading.
I am unable to hyperlink the site itself, as it was a group effort and the structure of the assignment did not allow for full file collaboration.
